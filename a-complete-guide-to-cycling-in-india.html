        <p>Cycling in India has a rich history, dating back to the colonial era when it was introduced as a mode of transport. Over the years, it has transformed into a cultural phenomenon, with cycling clubs, events, and communities sprouting across the country.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Days:</strong> In the early 20th century, bicycles became an essential part of daily life in India. Initially, they were used primarily by postal workers and government officials to cover long distances efficiently. As bicycles became more affordable, they quickly gained popularity among the general public, especially in rural areas where other modes of transport were either scarce or expensive. For many, owning a bicycle was a symbol of progress, allowing them to travel longer distances for work, education, and trade. The Indian postal service relied heavily on bicycles for decades, ensuring connectivity across remote villages. By the mid-1900s, cycles had become a staple for millions, shaping India’s early mobility landscape.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern Era:</strong> In recent years, cycling in India has undergone a remarkable transformation. While it remains a practical mode of transport, its role has expanded significantly, driven by rising fitness awareness, environmental concerns, and urban mobility initiatives. Cycling clubs have emerged in major cities, fostering a sense of community among enthusiasts who engage in long-distance rides, city tours, and social cycling events. The rise of dedicated cycling infrastructure, such as cycle-sharing programs and cycle lanes, has further encouraged urban cycling. Additionally, cycling marathons and mountain biking events, such as MTB Himalaya and the Tour of Nilgiris, have gained immense popularity, positioning India as an emerging hub for competitive and adventure cycling. With growing government support and increasing public interest, cycling has evolved from a simple mode of transport into a movement promoting sustainability, health, and exploration.</li>
