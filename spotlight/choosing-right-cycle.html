                <p>Cycling is one of the most efficient, eco-friendly, and enjoyable ways to commute, stay fit, and explore new places. With a wide range of cycles available, choosing the right one depends on factors such as terrain, distance, and purpose.</p>
            </div>

            <article class="blog-article">
                <h2>Road Cycles</h2>
                <p>Road cycles are built for speed and efficiency on smooth tarmac. They feature lightweight frames, thin tyres, and drop handlebars, allowing for an aerodynamic riding position. These cycles are ideal for long-distance rides, racing, and fitness training as they enable high speeds with minimal effort. However, they are not suited for rough terrain or heavy loads due to their narrow tyres and rigid frames.</p>
                
                <h2>Mountain Cycles</h2>
                <p>Mountain cycles are designed for rugged trails and uneven terrain. They have sturdy frames, thick knobbly tyres, and advanced suspension systems that absorb shocks from rocky paths and steep climbs. Hardtail mountain cycles feature front suspension, making them lighter and efficient for climbing, while full-suspension models provide greater comfort on rough descents. These cycles are perfect for adventure seekers but can feel slower and heavier on city roads.</p>
                
                <h2>Hybrid Cycles</h2>
                <p>Hybrid cycles combine the best features of road and mountain cycles, making them ideal for urban commuting and recreational riding. They feature flat handlebars for an upright riding position, medium-width tyres for stability, and lightweight frames for easy handling. These cycles are well-suited for paved roads and light trails, offering versatility and comfort. However, they do not match the speed of road cycles or the durability of mountain cycles on extreme terrain.</p>
                
                <h2>Commuter and City Cycles</h2>
                <p>Designed for everyday travel, commuter cycles prioritise practicality, comfort, and durability. They come equipped with features such as mudguards, chain guards, and luggage racks, making them ideal for work commutes or errands. Many city cycles have a step-through frame for easy mounting, particularly useful when wearing formal or traditional clothing. These cycles offer reliability and ease of use, ensuring a smooth ride in busy traffic.</p>
                
                <h2>Folding Cycles</h2>
                <p>Folding cycles are compact and highly convenient, making them a great choice for those who combine cycling with public transport or have limited storage space. Designed to fold quickly, they can be carried onto buses and trains or stored under a desk. Their small wheels and adjustable frames make them agile and easy to manoeuvre in urban environments. While highly portable, they are not built for long-distance rides or rough terrain.</p>
                
                <h2>Gravel Cycles</h2>
                <p>Gravel cycles bridge the gap between road and mountain cycles, offering a comfortable and stable ride on mixed surfaces. They have wider tyres and a more relaxed frame geometry, allowing them to handle rough roads, dirt tracks, and gravel paths with ease. These cycles are perfect for adventure touring and long-distance riding, providing greater stability than road cycles while maintaining good speed.</p>
                
                <h2>Touring Cycles</h2>
                <p>Touring cycles are specifically designed for long-distance travel and carrying heavy loads. They feature sturdy frames, wider tyres for extra comfort, and multiple attachment points for racks and panniers. With a relaxed riding position that reduces strain on long journeys, they are ideal for cyclists embarking on extended tours. Though highly durable and comfortable, touring cycles are heavier and slower than other types, making them less suitable for high-speed rides.</p>
                
                <h2>BMX Cycles</h2>
                <p>BMX cycles are designed for stunt riding, jumps, and short-distance racing. They have compact, strong frames, thick tyres, and a single gear for quick acceleration. These cycles are commonly used in skate parks and urban environments for tricks and jumps. While great for high-energy riding, they are not practical for commuting or long rides due to their small size and limited gearing.</p>
                
                <h2>Electric Cycles (E-Cycles)</h2>
                <p>Electric cycles, or e-cycles, come with a battery-powered motor that assists with pedalling. This extra boost makes cycling easier, especially for commuting, climbing hills, or travelling longer distances without excessive effort. Available in road, mountain, and commuter models, e-cycles cater to different riding needs. They are particularly useful for those looking to cycle with reduced physical strain, making them a great choice for older riders or those with physical limitations. However, they are heavier than traditional cycles and require regular battery charging.</p>
                
                <h2>Cargo Cycles</h2>
                <p>Cargo cycles are built for carrying heavy loads, making them a practical alternative to cars for short-distance transport. They feature reinforced frames and extended racks or cargo boxes for transporting goods, groceries, or even children. Some cargo cycles also come with electric assistance to help manage additional weight. Though highly practical, cargo cycles can be bulky and require extra space for parking and storage.</p>
                
                <h2>Recumbent Cycles</h2>
                <p>Recumbent cycles offer a unique reclined seating position that reduces strain on the back, neck, and wrists. This design makes them an excellent option for long-distance cycling, particularly for those with joint or muscle concerns. They come in two-wheel and three-wheel variations, providing stability and efficiency. While highly comfortable, recumbent cycles are less common and can be challenging to store or transport due to their elongated design.</p>
                
                <h2>Choosing the Right Cycle</h2>
                <p>Selecting the right cycle depends on several factors, including terrain, purpose, and personal preference. Road and gravel cycles are best for speed and endurance, while mountain cycles excel on rough trails. Hybrid and commuter cycles offer practical solutions for everyday travel, while folding cycles provide unmatched portability for urban riders. For those seeking a more effortless ride, electric cycles provide extra support, while touring and cargo cycles cater to specific transportation needs. By assessing your requirements, you can find the perfect cycle to enhance your riding experience.</p>
