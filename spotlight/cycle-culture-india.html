                <p>In recent years, cycling culture in India has experienced a significant resurgence, transcending mere transportation to embody a lifestyle choice embraced by urban dwellers and enthusiasts alike.</p>
            </div>

            <article class="blog-article">
                <h2>Inception and Historical Context</h2>
                <p>Cycling in India dates back to the late 19th century when cycles were introduced by the British. Initially considered a luxury item, cycles gradually gained popularity among the Indian populace due to their affordability and utility in a rapidly changing social and economic landscape. By the mid-20th century, cycling had become a common mode of transport for both urban and rural communities across India.</p>
                
                <h2>Decline and Resurgence</h2>
                <p>The advent of motorised vehicles in the post-independence era led to a decline in cycling as a primary mode of transportation. However, in recent decades, concerns over environmental degradation, traffic congestion, and sedentary lifestyles have sparked renewed interest in cycling. Cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Pune have witnessed a burgeoning cycling community supported by infrastructure improvements and advocacy efforts.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    "For a generation of Indians, cycling became something you did until you could afford a scooter - a symbol of upward mobility was leaving your bicycle behind"
                    <cite>Urban Historian, Dr. Ramesh Patel</cite>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h2>Present-Day Scenario</h2>
                <p>Today, cycle culture in India is multifaceted, encompassing recreational cycling, competitive sports, commuting, and fitness activities. Urban areas have witnessed a surge in cycling clubs, events, and dedicated cycle lanes, reflecting a growing awareness of sustainable urban mobility.</p>
                
                <h2>Health and Environmental Benefits</h2>
                <p>The resurgence of cycling is not merely a trend but a conscious choice driven by its myriad benefits:</p>
