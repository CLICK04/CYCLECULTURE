        <p>India’s urban landscapes are bustling with vehicles, leaving little room for cyclists who often brave unsafe roads to commute. Dedicated cycling lanes could be the answer to many challenges, from improving road safety to reducing pollution. Here’s how such lanes could transform cycling in India.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">A Safer Commute for Cyclists</h2>
        <p>According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, cyclists account for approximately 5% of road fatalities each year in India. The lack of segregated lanes forces cyclists to compete with larger vehicles, putting their lives at risk.</p>
        <p>International case studies, such as in Copenhagen, show that dedicated cycling lanes reduce accidents by up to 40%. Indian cities like Pune and Delhi have taken initial steps, but scaling these efforts nationwide is crucial for making cycling a safer option for commuters.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Tackling Traffic Congestion</h2>
        <p>With rising vehicle ownership, traffic congestion has become a major issue in cities like Bangalore, Delhi, and Mumbai. A study by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) suggests that over 60% of short-distance trips could be replaced with cycling if proper infrastructure were available.</p>
        <p>Dedicated lanes can encourage urban dwellers to switch to cycling, easing congestion and improving commute times for all road users.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Environmental and Health Benefits</h2>
        <p>Switching to bicycles for short commutes could significantly reduce air pollution. The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) estimates that promoting cycling in urban areas could lower carbon emissions by 1.5 million tons annually.</p>
        <p>Moreover, cycling promotes physical health. Studies show that regular cycling reduces the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and mental health issues. With safer lanes, more people would be motivated to take up cycling as a healthier and greener alternative.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Indian Cities Leading the Way</h2>
        <p>While most cities lag behind, a few are setting examples. Pune has introduced over 400 km of cycling tracks, although maintenance and encroachments remain challenges. Delhi’s “Raahgiri Day” and Bangalore’s cycling-friendly zones under the Smart Cities Mission show how dedicated efforts can inspire change.</p>
        <p>These initiatives highlight the growing interest in cycling infrastructure and demonstrate the potential for larger-scale adoption across the country.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Creating a Cycling Culture</h2>
        <p>Infrastructure alone won’t solve the problem. Building respect for cyclists and promoting awareness among motorists is equally important. Educational campaigns and stricter enforcement of traffic rules can complement the development of cycling lanes.</p>
        <p>In cities like Surat and Jaipur, active cycling communities are fostering a culture that encourages more people to take up cycling. Such efforts need to be amplified nationwide.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Dedicated cycling lanes could revolutionize urban mobility in India, offering safer roads, reducing traffic congestion, and promoting environmental sustainability. It’s time to invest in infrastructure that prioritizes cyclists, paving the way for a greener and healthier future.</p>
        <p>As India pedals toward progress, dedicated cycling lanes can be the catalyst that transforms how we move through our cities—safely and sustainably.</p>
