    <h2>Essential Cycling Tips for Hill Stations</h2>
    <p>Cyclists visiting high-altitude destinations should allow at least one to two days for acclimatisation before attempting long rides. It's essential to check the condition of rental cycles, particularly brakes and gear mechanisms, to ensure a safe ride. Helmets are mandatory at most rental shops and should always be worn for safety. Since mountain weather can be unpredictable, carrying lightweight rain gear is recommended. To make the most of the experience, cyclists should start their rides by 7 AM, avoiding peak afternoon mist and potential visibility issues. Additionally, monsoon months should be avoided due to slippery roads and increased risk of landslides.</p>
